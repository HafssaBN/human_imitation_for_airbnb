Moussa was a truly amazing host and we are so appreciative. My 2 friends and myself traveled to Marrakech for the first time from the U.S. and he sent a driver to pick us up from airport (who was also amazing and so nice). Upon arrival we were treated like family, and enjoyed our stay so much. The riad is beautiful, the included breakfast is delicious, and the experience was amazing. So much to learn about and enjoy.
Importantly: Marrakech was a big culture shock for myself and my buddies. Not in a bad way, but just very different than anywhere we had traveled before (including parts of South America). Moussa made us feel right at home, was very responsive if we had any questions and had tons of great recommendations. Would send my family to stay with him in a heartbeat.

Report Abdel","The rooms and the place are spectacular, everything is very original and beautiful, as shown in the photos. The bed was very comfortable, with a very good quality mattress and pillows. Everything was super clean and well cared for. The host Abdel always responded very quickly to messages and Moussa helped us a lot. We arrived very late from the airport and they came to pick us up; he was waiting for us to accompany us from the taxi to the hotel. He was very helpful, he explained where to go, what the best places were and how to get around the city. The room was cleaned every day, breakfast was very good and all the staff were very friendly. The location is excellent, very close to the center of the Medina, the Souk and many restaurants, and it is very easy to get to both the accommodation and the center.",3,8,0
